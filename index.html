											<h1>Foundation Models for Transfer Learning</h1>
										</header>
										<p>Making decisions based on past knowledge, or in other words, learning how to transfer and apply knowledge for novel tasks is a key milestone in robotics research. While there has been significant work on this topic in the past, currently the community has gotten a new tool to address and revisit old problems - foundational models. Foundational models show promise in overcoming the constraints of more traditional “narrow” AI models by being able to produce a wide range of outputs that can be used for different tasks. 
The fundamental goal of Robotics is to have intelligence embedded into a real physical agent that can interact, observe outcomes, learn, and apply its knowledge to novel tasks. To fulfill this goal many methods in the areas of transfer learning have emerged such as representation learning, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, sim2real, and interactive learning. 
Endowing foundational models with robotic biases could be a fundamental step towards all types of transferability in robotics such as Embodiment transfer - transferring from one robotic platform to another while considering their different embodiments, ii) Task/skill transfer - transferring methods or capabilities from one task to another, and iii) Knowledge transfer - transferring high-level concepts from one to another.
The goal of this workshop is to obtain an overview of the capabilities of current foundational models and their potential benefits for the robotics community. Furthermore, we want to set this current trend into the context of other established methods to combine the best of both worlds, which will facilitate a common understanding of transferability, as well as highlight contributions and encourage collaborations between the different areas.
